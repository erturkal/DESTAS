DESTAS (Dynamic EcoSystem and TrAnsport Simulator)

DESTAS is a box model that is derived from the previous work conducted by Erturk, 2008 and Erturk et al., 2015.

ESTAS was developed as a aquatic ecosystem model, using the box modelling approach. The first development was initiated as a part of the dissertation defended in Coastal Reseaarch and Planning Istitute (CORPI) of Klaipeda University (Lithuania) and applied to the Curonian Lagoon. A brief history of ESTAS is given below:

2009
Transport and kinetics are isolated from eachother, which helps the user to develop different kinetics based on the same box modeling framework.

2010-2014
Further tests, bugfixes, additional experimental kinetic sub-models.

2015
Finalization of development and application to climate change impact studies for the Curonian Lagoon.

2016-2018
No development, on its way for being a legacy software.

DESTAS (Dynamic ESTAS) project is an effort initated by the principal developer enhance and modernize ESTAS and bring it back to life. Features include

    - Dynamic memory management to eliminate the need of recompilation to different systems
    - Support of multiple kinetic models within one transport framework
